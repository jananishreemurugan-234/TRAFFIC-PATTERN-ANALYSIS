# TRAFFIC-PATTERN-ANALYSIS
## Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Tamizhan Skills

## Introduction
This project, Traffic Pattern Analysis, is developed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship at Tamizhan Skills. Rapid urbanization and increased vehicle usage have led to severe traffic congestion in cities. Understanding traffic patterns through data analysis is essential for effective traffic management, city planning, and road safety improvements.

This project analyzes traffic violation and vehicle data to identify peak traffic periods, traffic density trends, and anomaly patterns using data visualization and basic regression techniques.

## Problem Statement
Cities face frequent traffic congestion and road safety issues due to poor understanding of traffic flow patterns. Without analyzing traffic data, it becomes difficult to identify peak hours, high-risk vehicle categories, and time-based traffic anomalies.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze traffic data to identify peak congestion periods
- Study traffic violations across days and hours
- Identify vehicle types contributing most to violations
- Visualize traffic density using bar charts and heatmaps
- Analyze speed violation patterns
- Apply regression techniques for predictive insights

This project aligns with Tamizhan Skills internship objectives by applying data analytics to real-world urban challenges.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (Indian_Traffic_Violations.csv) contains traffic-related records, including:

- Date and Time of Violation
- Violation ID
- Vehicle Type
- Speed Limit
- Recorded Speed
- Date and time features are converted into usable temporal components for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
- Scikit-learn – Linear Regression
- Time-Series and Traffic Data Analysis

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic analytical workflow implemented in the code:

1.Loading traffic violation dataset

2.Converting date and time fields into numeric and categorical formats

3.Extracting month, day, and hour features

4.Identifying peak traffic hours using frequency analysis

5.Visualizing traffic density by hour using bar charts

6.Analyzing violations by day of the week

7.Studying violations by vehicle type

8.Analyzing speed limit vs recorded speed relationships

9.Creating a heatmap to show traffic density by day and hour

10.Applying Linear Regression to analyze speed patterns

These visualizations collectively form a traffic analytics dashboard.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science and analytics can be applied to traffic data to improve urban mobility and safety. Through the Tamizhan Skills Data Science & Analytics Internship, practical experience was gained in time-series analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. The insights from this project can assist city planners and traffic authorities in designing better traffic control strategies.
